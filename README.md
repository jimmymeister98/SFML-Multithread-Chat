---
## Introduction

- This program was a project for my "distributed systems" or in german "Verteilte Systeme" in the 3rd. semester of the Hochschule Niederrhein university of applied sciences.

## What does the program do

- The program is split into client and chat (to be uploaded) and is soley for exchanging text messages via the local network

## What libraries are neccessary?

- the newest version of [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php)

## Will it be maintained?

- I dont know, it isnt impossible because i had so much fun developing it.
- Maybe i try and develop some games that use a chat based on this.

## Whats up with all the todos and the server-sided memory leak?

- Well... i found those wayy too close to the deadline, so those are still on my todo list.
